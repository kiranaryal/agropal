                    <p>The ‘AgroPal’ is a project carefully designed as an online agriculture platform that helps farmers,
                        sellers, and buyers to interact with each other and get the products which they want to buy and
                        sell. ‘AgroPal’ is the combination of two words where ‘Agro’ stands for agriculture and ‘Pal’ is a
                        Nepali word i.e. roof where AgroPal combinely means agricultural products under the same roof.
                        This project is designed to help the farmers to get their needy things at a reliable price and people
                        who want to buy/sell fresh, organic, quality products as well. This platform is highly in demand
                        because of the situation we are facing these days.</p>
